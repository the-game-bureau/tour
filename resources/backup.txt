1 TIME FOR A BORING WALKING TOUR

START LOCATION

717 St. Charles Avenue (Outside)

BACKGROUND

Give the illusion that you're giving a walking tour.

Say, “Oh, one more thing..."

You step back inside, lock the deadbolt, and send the first clue.

OUTGOING CLUE

Oops, did you think this was a tour?! Nope—it’s a scavenger hunt! Let the games begin! TEXT ME THE WORD THAT WAS LIT UP OVER THE BAR and the hunt will begin!

EXPECTED RESPONSE

INSIGHTS

REPLY IF CORRECT

How insightful of you Team Marielle! I think you're up for this challenge.

LET'S GET IT STARTED!

START LOCATION

Standing on the street outside 717.

BACKGROUND

A good part of the tour takes place in Lafayette Square. Let's get them there. Hopefully they're dazed and confused.

OUTGOING CLUE

What a beautiful April day to celebrate a beautiful woman's birthday! Marielle, lead everyone to the place represented by the first flag below.

Wait, that’s not right. I always thought that was the flag for a city named after America’s favorite fighting Frenchman, but it’s not. The second flag is. Who knew?

HEAD TO THE NEARBY PLACE THAT THE SECOND FLAG REPRESENTS. WHEN YOU GET THERE TEXT ME WHERE YOU ARE.

Did you Google that? Great job team! Here's a picture from that funeral, right where you stand, 135 years ago:

So you think you're a pirate, huh? Well, have I got a haul for you! Take a look at the plain building to the right of Gallier Hall.

TEXT ME HOW MANY DOLLARS A DAY they’re talking about in the video below. You can save the video for later after you get your answer from it. You don't want to stand around looking like a teenager watching videos in public!

6 OUT OF THERE

BACKGROUND

"Out of There" Sculpture at Camp and Lafayette

OUTGOING CLUE

From pirates, to assassins. It's been reported that Lee Harvey Oswald used to hang out at the Newman building at the corner of Lafayette and Camp.

The Newman building has been replaced by a sculpture.

TAKE A PICTURE OF THE BIRTHDAY GIRL ROTATING THE SCULPTURE TO 274 DEGREES, ALSO KNOWN AS NORTH, NORTHEAST, BUT DON'T SEND ME THE PIC. TELL ME THE NAME OF THE FOUNDING FATHER THE SCULPTURE IS POINTING TO.

Do NOT text me "Benjamin Franklin". You may have to strain your neck a bit to find the father written in stone. He was the first Chief Justice of the United States, appointed by George Washington himself.

Here's some Oswald stuff that will help you in no way what-so-ever 🤣.
